            Where does it come from? Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is
            not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin
            literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard
            McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
            looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a
            Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
            classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum
            comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
            Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45
            BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular
            during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum
            dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The
            standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced
            below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de
            Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their
            exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914
            translation by H. Rackham.

            Where can I get some? There are many variations of passages of Lorem
            Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some
            form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even
            slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem
            Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden
            in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the
            Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this
            the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of
            over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence
            structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The
            generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition,
            injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
